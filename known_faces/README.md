# Known Faces

This folder contains reference images of known individuals used for facial recognition in the Attendance System project.

- Each image filename should match the personâ€™s name (e.g., `elon.jpg`).
- Images are used to generate facial encodings for recognition.
- You can add more images here as you expand the project.

ðŸ’¡ Tip: Keep the image files clear and well-lit for better recognition accuracy.
